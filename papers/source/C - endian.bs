# Introduction & Motivation # {#motivation}

There is a lot of proposals and work that goes into figuring out the "byte order" of integer values that occupy more than 1 octet (8 bits). This is nominally important when dealing with data that comes over network interfaces and is read from files, where the data can be laid out in various orders of octets for 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8-tuples of octets. The most well-known endian structures on existing architectures include "Big Endian", where the least significant bit comes "first" and is featured prominently in network protocols and file protocols; and, "Little Endian", where the least significant bit comes "last" and is typically the orientation of data for processor and user architectures most prevalent today.

In more legacy architectures (Honeywell, PDP), there also exists other orientations called "mixed" or "middle" endian. The uses of such endianness are of dubious benefit and are vanishingly rare amongst commodity and readily available hardware today, but nevertheless still represent an applicable ordering of octets.

In other related programming interfaces, the C functions/macros `ntoh` ("network to host") and `hton` ("host to network") (usually suffixed with `l` or `ul` or others to specify which native data type it was being performed on such as `long`) were used to change the byte order of a value and returned that value. This became such a common operation that many compilers - among them Clang and GCC - optimized the code down to use an intrinsic `__builtin_bytewap(...)`/`__builtin_bswap(...)` ([[msvc-builtins|for MSVC]], [[clang-builtins|for Clang]], and [[gcc-builtins|for GCC]]). These intrinsics often compiled into binary code representing cheap, simple, and fast byte swapping instructions available on many CPUs for 16, 32, 64, and sometimes 128 bit numbers. The `bswap`/`byteswap` intrinsics were used as the fundamental underpinning for the `ntoh` and `hton` functions, where a check for the translation-time endianness of the program determined if the byte order would be flipped or not.

This proposal puts forth the fundamentals that make a homegrown implementation of `htonl`, `ntoh`, and other endianness-based functions possible in Standard C code.




# Design # {#design}

This is a library addition. It is meant to expose both macros and enumeration values that can be used for both translation-time checks and for execution-time runs. It provides a way to check if the endianness within the preprocessor, and gives definitive names that allow for knowing whether the endianness is big, little, or neither. We state big, little, or neither, because there is no settled-upon name for the legacy endianness of "middle" or "mixed", nor any agreed upon ordering for such a "middle" or "mixed" endianness between architectures. This is not the case for big endian or little endian, where one is simply the reverse of the other, always, in every case, across architectures, file protocols, and network specifications.



## The Endianness Enumeration ## {#design-enum}

The enumeration is specified as follows:

```cpp
#include <stdendian.h>

#define __STDC_ENDIAN_LITTLE__ 1 /* some unique value */
#define __STDC_ENDIAN_BIG__ 2 /* some other unique value */
#define __STDC_ENDIAN_NATIVE__ see-below

typedef enum stdc_endian {
	stdc_endian_little = STDC_ENDIAN_LITTLE,
	stdc_endian_big = STDC_ENDIAN_BIG,
	stdc_endian_native = STDC_ENDIAN_NATIVE
} stdc_endian;
```

The goal of this enumeration is that if the system identifies as a "little endian" system, then `__STDC_ENDIAN_LITTLE__ == __STDC_ENDIAN_NATIVE__`, and that is how an end-user knows that the implementation is little endian. Similarly, a user can check `__STDC_ENDIAN_BIG__ == __STDC_ENDIAN_NATIVE__`, and they can know the implementation is big endian. Finally, if the system is neither big nor little endian, than `__STDC_ENDIAN_NATIVE__` is a unique value that does not compare equal to either value:


```cpp
#include <stdendian.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
	if (stdc_endian_native == stdc_endian_little) {
		printf("little endian! uwu\n");
	}
	else if (stdc_endian_native == stdc_endian_big) {
		printf("big endian OwO!\n");
	}
	else {
		printf("what is this?!\n");
	}
	return 0;
}
```

If a user has a Honeywell architecture or a PDP architecture, it is up to them to figure out which flavor of "middle endian"/"mixed endian"/"bi endian" they are utilizing. We do not give these a name in the enumeration because neither the Honeywell or PDP communities ever figured out which flavor of the 32-bit byte order of `2341`/`3412`/`2143`/etc. was strongly assigned to which name ("mixed" endian? "mixed-big" endian? "bi-little" endian?), and since this is not a settled matter in existing practice we do not provide a name for it in the C Standard. It is also of dubious determination what the byte order for a 3-byte, 5-byte, 6-byte, or 7-byte integer is in these mixed-endian types, whereas both big and little have dependable orderings.



## Hey! Some Architectures Can Change Their Endianness at Run-time! ## {#design-run.time}

This is beyond the scope of this proposal. This is meant to capture the translation-time endianness. There also does not appear to be any operating system written today that can tolerate an endianness change happening arbitrarily at runtime, after a program has launched. This means that the property is effectively a translation-time property, and therefore can be exposed as a compile-time constant. A future proposal to determine the run-time byte order is more than welcome from someone who has suitable experience dealing with such architectures and programs, and this proposal does not preclude their ability to provide such a run-time function e.g. `stdc_endian get_execution_endian(void);`.


## Generic Byte Swap and Exact-width Byte Swap ## {#design-byteswap}

In order to accommodate both a wide variety of architectures but also support exact-width integer optimized intrinsics, this proposal takes from the industry 2 forms of byteswap:

- one generic one which takes a pointer and the number of bytes to perform a reverse operation; and,
- a sequence of exact-width byte swapping instructions which map directly to intrinsics available in compilers and instructions in hardware.

These end up inhabiting a different header - the `stdbit.h` header - and have the following interface:

```cpp
#include <stdbit.h>

void stdc_byteswap(void* ptr, size_t n);
void stdc_byteswapN(uintN_t value);
```

where `N` is one of the exact-width integer types such as `8`, `24`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, and others. This matches the builtins ([[msvc-builtins|MSVC]], [[clang-builtins|Clang]], [[gcc-builtins|GCC]]) and the result of compiler optimizations that produce instructions for many existing architectures as shown in the README of [[portable-endianness|this portable endianness function implementation]].


### But Byte Swap Is Dangerous? ### {#design-byteswap-danger}

Byte swapping, by itself, is absolutely dangerous in terms of code portability. Users often program strictly for their own architecture when doing serialization, and do not take into consideration that their endianness can change. This means that, while `byteswap` functions can compile down to intrinsics, those intrinsics get employed to change "little endian" to "big endian" without performing the necessary check "am I already in the right endianness" check. Values that are *already* in the proper byte order for their target serialization get swapped, resulting in an incorrect byte order for the target network protocol, file format, or other binary serialization target.

The inclusion of the `<stdendian.h>` header reduces this problem, but does not fully eliminate it. This is why many Linux and BSDs include functions which directly transcribe from one endianness to another. This is why the [[endian-fallacy|Byte Order Fallacy]] has spread so far in Systems Programming communities, and why many create their own versions of this both in official widespread vendor code ([[linux-endian]]) and in more personal code used for specific distributions ([[portable-endianness]]).


### Selecting Endianness Functions ### {#design-byteswap-endianness}

Functions meant to transport bytes to a specific endianness need 2 pieces of information:

- the byte order of the input; and,
- the desired byte order of the output.

To represent any operation that goes from/to the byte order that things like `long long`s are kept in, the Linux/BSD/etc. APIs use the term "host", represented by `h`. Every other operation is represented by explicitly naming it, particularly as `be` or `le` for "big endian" or "little endian". Again, because of the severe confusion that comes from what the exact byte order a "mixed endian" multi byte scalar is meant to be in, there seems not to exist any widely available practice regarding what to call a PDP/Honeywell endian configuration. Therefore, mixed/bi/middle-endian is not included in this proposal. It can be added at a later date if the community ever settles on a well-defined naming convention that can be shared between codebases, standards, and industries.

The specification for the endianness functions borrows from many different sources listed above, and is as follows:

```cpp
#include <stdbit.h>

void stdc_store_leN(uintN_t value, void* ptr);
uintN_t stdc_load_leN(void* ptr);

void stdc_store_beN(uintN_t value, void* ptr);
uintN_t stdc_load_beN(void* ptr);
```

Note that this specification only exists for `N` types, similarly to the `stdc_byteswapN` functions. This is because the endianness need only be well-defined for exact-width types that contain no padding. Every other integer type in the C Standard does not have to be the advertised size, nor does it have to have no padding bits. This is unfortunate, but the only way we can preserve portable behavior amongst programs. The ultimate goal of these functions is portable behavior across implementations. Those relying on implementation-specific magic can continue to do so; this just makes a (very large) portion of serialization and deserialization work much more accessible and standard, without the risk of forgetting to properly check endianness. These functions do, of course, take into account the execution environment's endianness, and therefore are suitable for the task at hand. This includes serializing bytes into `ptr` without first doing a byteswap when the endianness of `value` and the specified `be`/`le` endianness match.



# Committee Polls / Questions # {#questions}

For the Committee, this proposal is, effectively, three parts:

1. the `<stdendian.h>` header;
2. the `<stdbit.h>` header and the `byteswap` functions (generic and width-specific); and,
3. the `<stdbit.h>` header and the `load`/`store`, width-specific functions.

These can be polled together or separately, depending on what the Committee desires. It is the author's recommendation that all are adopted to make serialization work with scalars much simpler and easier.
