Abstract: Variable-Length Arrays are commonly expected to be pulled off of what most implementations call their "stack", a dedicated area of memory for what are known as "automatic storage duration" variables and objects. However, this runs afoul of many inherent limitations unique to the stack, and exacerbated by the lack of terminology in the standard to handle it.
