# Introduction & Motivation

It was noted in discussion around the Typeof papers that `_Complex_I` and `_Imaginary_I` both are specifically stated to expand to expressions which yield a `const` r-value, which seems strangely specified. Considering almost no other macros are specified like this, I looked into the past a bit to see if there was any particular reason for the `const`-ness of the Macro. The archives failed to yield any particularly enlightening reasoning for why this constant, of all the constants, was marked as `const`. The constants were introduced in C99, and have always been `const` qualified. The C99 Rationale makes no mention of it being `const`, and only talks about `float` as if the macro was not `const`-qualified.

Because it may become possible to observe types in the (very near) future, we should remove the `const` qualification from these macro productions. Current analysis indicates that this should affect no code, as all current generic facilities perform l-value conversion and the type of these macros are expressions (r-values), and thusly cannot have their address taken directly to expose it.




# Wording

The following wording is relative to [N2596](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2596.pdf).

**Remove `const` from 7.3.1 paragraph 4 and 5**

<blockquote>
<p><sup>4</sup> ...; the macro

> ```cpp
>      _Complex_I
> ```

expands to a constant expression of type <del><b>const float _Complex</b></del><ins><b>float _Complex</b></ins>, with the value of the imaginary unit.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><sup>5</sup> The macros

> ```cpp
> imaginary
> ```

and

> ```cpp
> _Imaginary_I
> ```

are defined if and only if the implementation supports imaginary types;<sup>210)</sup> if defined, they expand to `_Imaginary` and a constant expression of type <del><b>const float _Imaginary</b></del><ins><b>float _Imaginary</b></ins> with the value of the imaginary unit.
</blockquote>


**Remove `const` from G.6 paragraph 1**

<blockquote>
<p><sup>1</sup> ... <br/>

... are defined, respectively, as <b>_Imaginary</b> and a constant expression of type <del><b>const float _Imaginary</b></del><ins><b>float _Imaginary</b></ins> with the value of the imaginary unit.</p>
</blockquote>
