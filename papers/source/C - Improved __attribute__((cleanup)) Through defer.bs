Abstract: Many compilers's "cleanup" attribute has long-since provided scope-based, compile-time deterministic, well-known mechanism for the C language to clean up resources of all kinds (not just memory). This propoal attempts to standardize something as close to existing practice as possible while providing a select and measured few set of behaviors to ensure greater portability and usability in the C ecosystem.
