# Motivation

It has been 9 years since [[on-vector-bool|Howard Hinnant wrote about the standard's vector of booleans]], and 16 years since the Standard Library's Technical Report 2 failed to deliver proper bit abstractions to the ISO C++ Standard.

Committee members and C++ enthusiasts still have a mild chuckle and/or existential crisis about `std::vector<bool>`. It is consistently brought up during design discussion involving templates, waved about like a sword against those who might specialize a template for any reason, good or bad. Despite 3-4 papers proposing fixes and alternatives we haven't put anything in the standard library, mostly due to people just falling off the wagon / not having enough time to carry it through. Whether it's Alisdair Meredith's work in the Standard Library Technical Report [[N2050]] or Vincent Reverdy's bit iterators and friends in [[P0237]], all forms of progress except Jens Maurer's `<bit>` header has not managed to survive. With the primary papers pushing for better bit handling meeting the so-called "Technical Graveyard"s that are Technical Report 2 and Library Technical Specification Fundamentals version 2 and 3, these papers â€” despite not having many technical challenges â€” have been mostly overlooked.

This paper fixes that.
