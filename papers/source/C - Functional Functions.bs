Abstract: Nested Functions (GCC), Blocks (Clang & Apple-derived compilers), Wide Function Pointers (Borland and existing C library functions), and Lambdas (C++) provide a series of takes on how to, effectively, bundle functions with data in different ways and transport that information to the caller. This proposal goes through the existing practice and enumerations their tradeoffs so as to propose the best possible solution to the problem space at hand.
