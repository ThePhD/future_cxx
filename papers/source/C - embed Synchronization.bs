# Changelog # {#changelog}



## Revision 2 - October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2025 ## {#changelog-r2}

- Adjust wording for example which used old semantics around "matching the first/second form".
- Fix minor specification issues around "shall be ..." versus just saying "is..." (statement of fact versus weirdly-worded constraint).
- "shall be implementation-defined" -> "is/are implementation-defined".
- Incorporate and synchronize changes between C and C++
	- Make sure to consider CWG Issues [3013](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/3013.html), [3014](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/3014.html), [3015](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/3015.html), [3016](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/3016.html), [3017](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/3017.html), and [3018](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/3018.html).



## Revision 1 - February 16<sup>th</sup>, 2025 ## {#changelog-r1}

- Revise current strategy to fit results of GCC requests and C++ standardization.
	- Directives are expanded after the name, unconditionally, all the time.
	- `offset` parameter has additional examples and clarification of calculation.
- Fix typos:
	- "an" -> "a" 
	- "2" -> "two"



## Revision 0 - December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024 ## {#changelog-r0}

- Initial Release! 🎉




# Introduction and Motivation # {#intro}

During the standardization discussion of `#embed` in WG21 in the last year for [[P1967]] and [[P3540]], several adjustments were requested to the behavior of `#embed` for niche cases. This paper synchronizes the behavior between what WG21 has voted into the C++26 Release and what is contained in the current C23/C Working Draft.

The requested synchronizations are as follows:

- No potential double-expansion of preprocessor parameters allowed in any way.
- Preprocessor expansion of parameters always happens, not just for `limit`, and it is performed for everything after the resource name instead of just for inside of the parameters (a previous design in the C++ proposal, revision 13).
- Make it clear we're producing a sequence of (preprocessor) tokens, and not necessarily (post-processor, Phase 7) tokens.
- Adding the extremely-popular and already-implemented `gnu::offset` and `clang::offset` parameters.

The wording below attempts to accomplish all of these things.

*📝 IMPORTANT Editor's Note: Replace all instances of "implementation resource width" with simply "resource width".*

*📝 IMPORTANT Editor's Note: Delete all of ❡5 and ❡6, as its constraints have been moved up to just after ❡1 and redundant text has been eliminated, while a new definition for "empty" is defined in the semantics.*

<ins>

<sup>13✨</sup> **EXAMPLE** &emsp; If the directive matches one of the first two forms, then processing as in normal text only applies to everything but the resource name. If the directive matches the third form, then processing as in normal text applies to the entire directive:

```cpp
#define offset(ARG) limit(ARG)
#define prefix(ARG) suffix(ARG)
#define THE_ADDITION "teehee"
#define THE_RESOURCE ":3c"
#embed ":3c"        offset(2) prefix(THE_ADDITION)
#embed THE_RESOURCE offset(2) prefix(THE_ADDITION)
```

is equivalent to:

```cpp
#embed ":3c" limit(2) prefix("teehee")
#embed ":3c" limit(2) prefix("teehee")
```
